        story: "We left because my husband was killed and my son was badly burned when a bomb exploded on our house. For two years I have supported my children in Turkey.  I sometimes found work sewing here, but I was lucky to receive support from the local Turkish community.  They showed me true generosity. We are excited to move to Norway.  I want to work, definitely, but the first thing I must do when I get there is to help my son find good medical treatment. When the bomb exploded on our house, he was very badly burned. He cannot open his mouth. He cannot eat properly. I have to feed him small spoonfuls of broth so he can eat. He had three surgeries in Turkey, but none were successful. I love him so much, but it has been hard on all of us. I am so tired.  In Norway, I want my kids to go to school.  It’s time they all go back to school. I have a 16-year-old daughter who went to school up to 5th grade in Syria. But because of the trauma, forgot some of the most basic things.  She doesn’t even know how to write her name anymore.  What do I want most from a life in Norway?  A place to raise my children where they are safe and where they feel safe. I want my son to receive medical care and for all of my children to receive an education so that they will have a better life than I have had.  Amina is one of the 200 Syrians living in Turkey who were selected for resettlement in Norway. Two years ago, Amina fled Aleppo for Turkey with her six children (ages 16 to 4 years old)",

        story: "When I decided come to live in Canada, I faced the fear of the unknown, starting from scratch in a country with a different language, a different climate and a long way from my family and friends; but, I decided to put aside sadness and nostalgia and meet life's challenges head on.  I came to this country more than 13 years ago, when I was 25 years old, and just started my career as a professional. In El Salvador, access to employment was difficult and I had been waiting for a couple of months for a place as a radiologist in a Salvadoran Hospital, but the opportunity never came. This situation despaired me, because meant that so many years of study were useless.  In those months, my mother raised the possibility of migrating to Canada as a resident. I had never considered living in another country before, but I felt that in El Salvador I could not make progress. I had a hard time at the beginning, because I had my dreams, the ones you had since childhood, studying, getting a good job, buying a house, helping my family.  Here, things have not been easy, one of the main problems at the start was the language, and I thought I could speak English, but as soon as I got off the airplane, I knew I did not. My studies did not work either, although I tried to validate my degree, in college they told me that I had to start a career again.  As I had to work I left my profession aside and dedicate myself to the construction, it was one of the hardest changes, going from an office job to a physical job, but I do not complain. Thanks to this job, I have been able to travel, to know many places and enjoy living conditions that would not have been there.  When I think of El Salvador, it is inevitable to think about my friends, the beach, and coffee, but, above all, I think about my family. Here I learned the true value of the family; I think that if my mother did not live here and had not been from the beginning, I would not have endured being so far away.  I brought my collection of coins that I started as a teenager, in high school. I thought that was the only thing of value he possessed. I imagined that here I would meet people from more countries and I assumed that I could increase my collection.  Sometimes, when I feel that I do not belong to Canada, but I do not feel part of my country, then I talk to my sisters and my nephews and I see my collection and a couple of books that I brought with me and I find again the bond that unites me land.  I do not know if I will return to El Salvador soon, but while I can help my family to get ahead, as a small way to repay what this country has given me.",

        story: "My name is Fadil and I am from Morocco. I am a beneficiary of IOM AVRR programme. I had been living in Greece for 4 years and with IOM Greece help I returned back to my country on July 2017, benefiting with Reintegration assistance.  As I had a 9 year experience as a butcher before migration, I requested to use IOM’ s assistance in order to make my own butcher shop. I benefited from Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration Programme (AVRR) and now I run my own butcher shop in my homeland in Marrakech. IOM Greece staff came recently to evaluate my business and I am really happy to find my shop very neat and clean. I got also a sanitary license from the relevant administrative commune. My business is running well as there are no similar shops in the area. IOM thank you very much, I will never forget this assistance.  Reintegration is a process that enables the returnee migrant to participate again in the social, cultural, economic and political life of his or her country of origin.",

        story: "I was 19 years old when I left Nigeria. I had just completed my secondary school education and I was ready to start my first year of University when a man approached my mother with a proposition for me to go study abroad. He managed to convince my mother that he could get me a scholarship in Italy and all I had to do was give him the necessary documents for him to process the paperwork.  After a few weeks the man came to our house and informed my mother that I had been accepted into a school in Italy and that it was a fully paid scholarship. He also informed us that I would be travelling by air to Europe and we should leave everything in his hands. Neither I nor my mother had ever travelled outside of Nigeria, let alone taken a flight. So when the man said that we would depart from the northern state of Nigeria instead of my home state Lagos, we did not question him.  We drove from Lagos to Kano for 16 hours in a very small car; we were packed in like sardines. When we arrived in Kano, the man handed us over to another group of men who then told us that we were going to depart for Niger later on that evening. A small car came to pick us up and it drove us across the border to Zinder in Niger. In Zinder we were taken to a place where we met other people from different African countries. A group of men then came and told us that we were going to go to Libya later on in the evening. I did not know where Libya was, and I was also unaware that we were going to be driven through the desert. We left Zinder and went to Agadez. 30 of us were loaded onto the back of one small truck and we were given large sticks to support ourselves so that we wouldn't fall off when the truck was moving. After few days of driving through the desert we arrived in Libya. The journey to Libya was very tough as we drove past many dead bodies and a lot of people fell ill on the way. Whenever someone was too sick to continue with the journey, the driver would just leave them in the desert and keep on driving.  When we arrived in Libya, the 'pusher man' gathered all the women who were in the truck and handed us over to another man. The man took us to Qatrun, a city in Libya, and later sold us to a “Madam” who took us to a house and told us that we would be now working for her. I was very confused as I did not know where I was, and I just wanted to go back home. The “Madam” told me that if I wanted to go back home I had to raise a certain amount of money and then she would let me go. She then forced me into prostitution so that I could raise the money. The woman was very strict and we could not leave the house or make any phone calls. Every time a client came to collect us we would be heavily guarded. A few of the girls in the house tried to escape but they were easily caught and sold again to another “Madam” in a different area.  It took me 10 months to raise the money that the woman wanted, and after I paid her the money I was allowed to leave the house. I met other Nigerian women in the area close to the house where I was living and they allowed me to stay with them whilst I was trying to figure out how to get back home to Nigeria. One night whilst I was sleeping, the house we were in was raided by the police and we were taken to a detention camp. The conditions in the camp were very horrible and a lot of people where tortured and abused there. After spending a month in the camp, officials from the Nigerian embassy registered our names and we were soon returned home by IOM. I was so happy to be back home in Nigeria as I did not know how I was ever going to return. My family was happy to see me as they did not know what had happened to me. Because of my experience in Libya, I decided that I was going to share my story with people in my community so that they do not have to experience what I gone through. I joined a programme that was being run by IOM called Migrants as Messengers whereby returnees like myself go into various communities advocating for safe and regular migration. I learnt how to conduct interviews and to use a smartphone kit to film interviews. Now in addition to sharing my experiences, I also conduct video interviews of fellow returnees who attempted to go to Europe via Libya. Collecting their stories helps us raise awareness of the dangers of the journey and we hope that more people will not be deceived and tricked into embarking on this journey.  The things I witnessed in Libya are unimaginable and I would not want anyone else to experience them, that is why I am proud to be a messenger.”",

We first moved to Afrin, but were forced to move once again in March 2018. That is when we started our journey to Greece.
