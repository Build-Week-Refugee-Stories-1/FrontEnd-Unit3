        story: "I am an American born in the Philippines, which is where my mother is from. I came to the UK in 2009 as a student for the Anthropology of Food Master's programme at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. After finishing the programme, I went back to the US and proceeded to apply for a Post-Study Work Visa, which is a visa now sadly on hiatus. I was granted the two-year visa and re-entered the UK in 2011, whereupon I entered several lines of work in order to gain work experience as well as support living in London. Sometimes I would work 70-hour weeks in two jobs and I'd still barely make ends meet. However, I was lucky to meet a number of people through my work. Eventually, through a combination of my degree, experience in social media and content management, and especially my work in pubs, I found work at a new East London brewery, The Five Points Brewing Company. I was the first hire after the head brewer, and was made full-time only a few weeks before my Post-Study Work Visa expired. I received my UK Residence Card the exact day my PSWV expired, and celebrated the start of my new visa, Tier 2 General Work Visa, with a curry. In my work with The Five Points, I have helped build a successful brewery that is undergoing its biggest expansion yet. We now employ 10 people, and will employ at least 2 further members of staff before the year is complete. Additionally, alongside our brewery's director I help organize the London Brewers' Market, which is a regular event at Old Spitalfields Market in East London that showcases independent breweries from all around London and allows them to sell their beer directly to the public, and allows the public to meet their local breweries as well as to try the fantastic range of brews this city has to offer. I further promote many small businesses, such as pubs and bottle shops, who stock our ales through events and social media. I even help promote other London breweries with my activity in the London Brewers' Alliance. I've been featured in the Total Ales beer blog in a new series called London Beer People, and I've represented our brewery in other British cities at events, as well as in Rome. Soon, I'll be going to Copenhagen on behalf of our brewery, and I will also be representing us in events in Spain and, later in the year, the USA. I'll be organizing The Five Points' involvement with several beer festivals and events this year, including London Beer City and Leeds International Beer Festival. Plus, we have two other London Brewers' Markets to plan, along with some possible offshoot events. It's hard work, but exceedingly rewarding when I can walk into a pub and see our beer on the bar, and know I had a part in putting it there.",

        story: "I am from the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. I was born in Bosnia, lived in Serbia and married a Croatian man. I have lived in Portugal for 18 years now. While growing up, my parents were frustrated to know that I was so passionate about theatre. I therefore ended up reluctantly studying Law for one year at the University in Belgrade in Serbia. Two years before starting University, I had fallen in love with a Croatian scout who was living in Sarajevo. We had been in a long-distance relationship for three years – him in Sarajevo and me in Belgrade – and we got married when I turned 20. I moved in with him in Sarajevo and gave birth to our twin girls. I also quickly changed my University degree, from Law to Theatre in 1990. Unfortunately, the war broke out in 1992 and my dream fell apart. We were in danger irrespective of any of the troops that would enter the city because I was Serbian and he was Croatian. We were able to flee Belgrade to where my parents were living. Eight of us lived in a two-bedroom flat. I continued studying theatre at University and as time went by I began to develop children’s theatre projects and specialized in child theatre. Even though I was very successful, the life conditions around me were hard. Men were mobilized to go to war, essential goods in supermarkets were sold out and we were constantly living in a climate of fear. NATO then intervened in the country in 1999 and we decided to leave. My brother had previously studied in Portugal as part of the Erasmus European program and had lived in Lisbon at that time, so he invited us to stay with him. We arrived in Portugal on the 25th May 1999. My eight-year-old daughters integrated and learned the language very quickly, hence becoming my translators. It took longer for me to adapt and to be able to work again in theatre. I did not know a word of Portuguese and I thought I would never be able to perform again. I began by looking for places where I could work in English and I found the Irish pub in the Cais do Sodré area. At that time, my husband was working during the day in a transportation company. It looked as if everything was fine, but we were already miles away from each other. We got divorced a year later and he returned to Bosnia. I stayed alone with my two daughters in Portugal. I knew that I could not work as an actress because I did not speak Portuguese, but I could translate my plays with some help. I ended up translating my first play and preparing all the Portuguese actors for the show. At the last minute, one of the actresses was not able to perform and the theatre company convinced me to learn the lines in Portuguese by heart. This is how I began acting again. It was so motivating, to realize that people were receptive of my work, that I ended up taking advantage of my accent and the fact that I stand out. From then on, I have not stopped. At that time I started children’s theatre and I began teaching theatre classes. I am a member of the Palco de Chocolate association, in which I teach theatre to children and young people. Meanwhile, I also continue to perform and produce plays with my theatre company and I do performances that tackle several social issues. In 2006 I presented the story of my life in a play called “Eastern Wind” (“Vento Leste”) which became a national and international success. It was an opportunity to process the pain caused by the war and a chance to raise people’s awareness about the sad reality of war. Both my daughters have finished their college degrees in Lisbon and are living apart from each other. One stayed in Lisbon and the other moved to Belgrade, reflecting the way I feel – divided between both countries. Nowadays I feel that I belong a bit there and here. Are these consequences of war? War is like this, it expels people from their homes and forces them to pack their whole life in a suitcase. I came to understand that it can fit, but it is necessary to start packing well before any war starts. My parents prepared me so well that my suitcase was already packed by the time the war broke out. Life is a challenge, so do not forget to prepare your suitcase, because you never know when you will need it. We need to be aware of our capacities, tolerate differences and always be ready to learn and adapt.",

        story: "My name is Katherine Tinoco Reyes. I am Peruvian and I have been living in the United Kingdom for 2 years. My husband is British and that's why we came together to study a master's degree in London and follow our dreams. Having left my country and my loved ones, nostalgia is part of my every day. This motivated my need to fill that void with activities related to my beloved and remembered Peru. Today from the distance, our customs, typical dishes, dances, and everything Peruvian is invaluable, which boosted my need to start my search for these activities. Dancing has always been my passion and I enjoy doing it. I did it since I was a child. Like my father always tells us it is in the blood and what is inherited cannot be stolen. I participated in different folkloric events in my school and university, I even was part of the dance events of the Brisas del Titicaca cultural association. There I developed and complemented many of my dance skills with the typical dances of Peru. With the vision of being able to transmit this experience and passion I started ArtPerUK! An initiative that I founded in May 2019. By teaching other migrant compatriots to dance to Peruvian music, we learn and have fun by sharing the rich musical culture thanks to dancing. I started with a program of typical dances from Peru, considering dances from the coast, mountains and jungle like 'festejo', 'caporales' and the popular 'anaconda', at the facilities of Queen Mary of London University. Forthcoming classes will include 'valicha', 'marinera', among others, but we are going step by step to be able to learn together. The participants, for now, are Peruvian residents in the United Kingdom who want to practice, improve and enjoy a few hours with compatriots who share the passion for Peru and our dances. We have also had Spanish and Latin participants and I hope, one day, to have British students in order to spread the Peruvian culture. ArtPerUK has more than 120 interested students, classes are 30 to 35 students on average and we have made presentations at public events to showcase our talent and continue to transmit the Peruvian culture where we are going. For our national holidays we produced a flashmob in London Bridge. It was a joy for many Peruvians and their families to see how their relatives who are so far away participate in these cultural activities! My vision for the future is to be able to make this a base initiative to form a dance cast that can participate in different events in London and thus improve the propagation of Peruvian culture. I hope this initiative continues and grows, so that we can leave a legacy to our families in the United Kingdom and know that we did something so they can learn more about our wonderful country, Peru.",

        story: "I am half English and half Welsh; I currently live in Albania where I work as a freelance writer. I left England aged 21 because I didn’t like the country and didn’t see a future there; I didn’t like the weather, the people, the government, the culture, or the way society was. I spent 10 years in Malta before living for almost a year in Cyprus. I do not consider myself English anymore and I know very little about what life is like there. Instead I prefer to consider myself a world citizen, someone who can travel, learn, and explore. Whilst I am proud of my Celtic/English heritage, it does not define me. I feel I have more to give in other places. I came to Albania by chance, in 2017. My first impression of Albania was very positive; I loved the energy and the interesting aesthetic feel of the country. It instantly impressed me. I also had an incredibly warm welcome from Albanian people; this was something very special and was a big part of my decision to stay here. Home for me is Albania now. I don’t miss anything from the UK! Well... maybe I miss English bacon, clotted cream, and the shop “Lush”, but that is really it! Apart from my job as a freelance writer, I try to work on charity and social issues; I am an activist particularly for the environment and women’s rights. I try to give back all that I can and to use the skills and influence that I have for a good purpose. I enjoy having the ability to make people see beautiful things in their country, that they may have previously taken for granted. These things give me immense happiness and a feeling of purpose - I thrive from them and this motivates me every day. To all my fellow Britons, there is a piece of advice that I would like to give: There is a whole world out there — go, explore, learn, travel, drink in the experiences that life has for you, meet people from every culture and background and expand your mind beyond what the media tells you. And to my fellow Albanians, I would like to say that whilst life may be hard for many of you, you are so blessed in a number of other ways. Your culture, your character, the beautiful surroundings that you inhabit — you have more in many ways than the countries you dream of escaping to. Remember that the grass is not always greener on the other side.",

        story: "As a 24-year-old archeologist, spending 10 months in Athens was a dream come true. I met a lot of people while in Athens and visited all the famous museums and ancient monuments that this historic city has to offer. I was attracted to Greek culture and history like a magnet, I just couldn’t get enough. The most valuable experience I gained, however, was through a Greek acquaintance who later became a very close friend of mine. He taught me how to print postcards and create handmade souvenirs, frames and diaries showcasing Greek history and mythology. We were very creative with our work and sold this memorabilia to tourists. Once I was confident in my abilities, I decided to take my newly acquired skills back to my hometown of Tbilisi, Georgia. I wanted to return home and produce the same material, but with Georgian traditions. I hope to create a cultural dialogue between Athens and Tbilisi by selling similar artifacts that tell different stories. I found the voluntary return programme run by IOM, the UN Migration Agency, to be the best solution for returning home. Thanks to the reintegration assistance provided by the programme, I will receive all the necessary equipment I need to build my workshop. This will allow me to create and sell original, handmade souvenirs that reflect Georgian tradition and culture. I love my home country and I am extremely excited to share its traditions and history with the world.",
